Gherkin - Bussiness readable, domain specific language
Keywords: Scenario(TC), Feature, Feature file, Scenario outline, Step definition

Scenario: is just a TC
GIVEN precondition
When purpose
Then expected output
And other expected output/ other when statement or given statement
BUT is for error messages maybe

Feature: represents bussiness requirement

Feature.file has .feature extension with the scenarios in them

Scenario outline: runs a single test n number of times as per the provided parameters
just put Examples: after test with all the data

for each step in the feature file we had to write the corresponding code in 
stepdefinitons.java file

TestRunner is used to run - TestNG/Junit

sencha.js - next.js


Files hierarchy:
Project
|-src/main/java
|-src/main/resources
|-src/test/java
	|-features(package)
		|-Firstfeaturefile.feature(has the gherkin code)
		|-secondfeaturefile.feature
	|-cucumberOptions
		|-TestNGRunnerfile.java(executes our feature files)
	|-stepDefinitions
		|-hooks.java(has setup & tear down or other smaller setups/teardowns
which might not be for all uses tags to achieve it)
		|-mainsteps.java(has the code for each step in gherkin code)
|-src



Re-usability: just repeat steps used/coded before. Also include parameterizarion to help
diversity. 

Hooks: contain re-usable code like setup and tear down
